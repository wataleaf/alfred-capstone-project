This Python code consists of a Pokémon game! It's fairly simple in terms of usage, and rounds might be quick past.

Purpose/Program Statement
My program allowed the user to battle with an AI bot, and generates random Pokémon in that battle.
It's addressing people who want to play pokemon games, but don't want to end up spending 60+ dollars just to battle!

Target Audience
The target audience is primainity people who enjoy pokemons specifilly gamers.
My program is acting as a solution to the ever increasing game market showing people games don't have to be expensive.

Solution + Limitations
Some limitations the program does have is not being able to show the actual pokemon and only the name, I tried to see if there was a way to be able but the best thing I could do was allow for a link of the image of the pokemon, It wasn't exactly how I wanted it to be so I ended up cutting it in the final draft.

Key Features / Key Components
The game includes random Pokémon selection, player actions (attack/defend), dynamic damage calculation, and turn-based battle logic with win conditions. It also uses dictionaries to store Pokémon stats, an integer to track turns, and a boolean to manage the defend state.

Technical Challenges + Future Plans 
If I had more time I'd deftinaly add a way for the user to exit, or swap their pokemon when damaged.
The hardest thing to figure out for me was a way to acutally calcualte and do the damage, I know pokemon uses the Bulbapedia damage formula but trying to implement that into techsmart was pretty diffcult.
If I had more time I'd definitely add a way for the user to exit, or swap their pokemon when damaged.

Project Timeline
The way I broke this project up was by working on it bit by bit everyday, and reseaching different ways to actually approach it
